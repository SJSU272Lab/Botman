##Introduction

ChatBots are on a rise. These are automated computer programs, which respond to user queries by employing a suitable ML algorithm to gauge what the user is asking and reply appropriately. Bots have appeal and huge fan following not only among the developer community, but also among the non-developer tech community. People can now exploit the easy integration of their bots with the chat platforms like, Facebook, Slack or Tinder to automate certain tasks, thereby saving time or increasing productivity.

## Project Deliverables

In the design, we are thinking of devising a simple website, which we will host as a service that will guide a user through steps in designing his own slack bot.
The website will iteratively ask questions that we will use in the program and create the bot.

##	Technology Stack

We are using Python, node.JS, JavaScript, Slack API, Botkit, Git, Angular.JS, HTML and CSS.

##	Need and Advantages

This is a custom framework which will help many people who are new or are unaware of programming concepts but want to use slack and make a bot.

##USER STORIES

An office work group manager has to maintain list of the things that need to be bought for the meeting. This can be done by adding an inventory management bot to the slack channel. This bot could act as a manager and record the requests for stationary products. While discussing on the channel, if any employee thinks of something to be bought then instead of writing down in a separate notepad and then saving it somewhere, he can just request it over the channel and the bot could record them. This will reduce the overhead of physically recording things or creating a portal where the employee has to raise a request for the same.

##USER GUIDE
######STEPS TO GET BOTMAN WORKING ON LOCALHOST-
-	Download or Fork the Repository
- Install all the dependencies using 'npm install' command
- Run app.js using node cmd
- Open localhost at port 3000 in your browser
- Application will be started
- Visit our hosted website

######STEPS TO CREATE YOUR FIRST BOT
- Login into the application using github
- You can find **_STEPS_** tab where all the instructions are given
- First you need to create a new heroku directory
- Next step is make that directory master using the button provided in the steps page
- Open editor type in your code for the bot
- Go to the **Upload** tab and upload your app.js and package.json files and the bot will be live within seconds on your slack channel

##FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS
- Currently we support NodeJS bots
- We are going to provide support for other languages like Python soon
